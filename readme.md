Pokémon Dataset Challenge

Using the attached dataset answer TWO of the following questions:

1. Train a model to predict if a Pokémon is legendary.
2. Design the ‘best’ squad of 6 Pokémon, using any measure of ‘best’ you deem relevant.
3. Can you identify the type of a Pokémon from other metadata? If you answered question 1 instead of question 2, there are extra points for taking an unsupervised approach to this question.
